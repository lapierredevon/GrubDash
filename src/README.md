# Thinkful Project - GrubDash

The goal of this project was to use Express to build an API that follows restful design principles and to create routes with complex validation middleware.

This application organizes the routes by creating mini routes using separate router and controller files.The middleware and validation functions were added to the controller files and imported into the router file.
